Gameplay overview
-----------------

Game board is a random picture of size 15x15.
Start from the top-left corner of the board.
Select a new color for the top-left pixel, 
and all adjacent pixels of the same color 
will be painted over with the new color. 
The goal is to drench the whole board with your 
own color. You cannot use the same color twice.

Zyan Drench has several modes: play against Android 
phone (with adjustable skill level), play solo 
(classic single-player mode) and network game.

Single player mode
------------------

In a single-player mode (classic Drench game)
you have 30 steps to drench the board.
If you find it too hard or too easy to stay within
the limit, you can use settings screen to adjust it.

Two player modes
----------------

In a two-player mode there are no limits: 
the game ends when there are no more pixels
to paint over. A player who painted over
more pixels wins the game.

The first player always starts from the 
top-left corner of the board, and the second 
player takes the opposite corner. On each move, 
you cannot use your last color or the color
of your opponent's corner.

For the sake of usability, the game always 
displays the board so that your corner is top-left.

Play against Android
--------------------

This is the most available two-player gaming mode.
There are three skill levels of Android player:
Dumb, Normal (default skill level) and Expert.
Android player is a great way to practice before 
playing with skilled human gamers.

Network game modes
------------------

Choose Start Wifi game from the main menu 
to start a network game server. The game will 
display your server's IP address and wait for 
incoming connections. When your opponent connects 
to the server, Zyan Drench will display 
the board and start the game.

To connect to the server, use the Join Wifi game
button from the main menu. You'll need to enter 
the IP address of the game server to join the game. 

Please note that Zyan Drench doesn't have 
a central server and always uses peer-to-peer
connections. Take in mind that you can only 
play with phones on the same Wifi network
as your phone.

Have fun!
